A SQL project providing critical insights into the impact of the pandemic on each country. 

Explored, cleaned, and analyzed COVID-19 data with comprehensive SQL queries processing over 160k rows. The analysis highlighted the likelihood of death upon contracting COVID-19 for each country, offering a clear picture of mortality rates. Identified countries with the highest infection rates, highlighting areas with severe outbreaks. By examining infection rates and death counts, pinpointed the most affected nations. Calculated the percentage of the global population that had been vaccinated, providing a snapshot of vaccination progress. 

This project offered valuable information for understanding and mitigating the effects of COVID-19 globally.
