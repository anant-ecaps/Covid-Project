# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project ðŸ¦ 

## Overview

This SQL project provides critical insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each country.

## Project Details

In this project, I explored, cleaned, and analyzed COVID-19 data using comprehensive SQL queries, processing over 160k rows of data. The analysis yielded several key insights:

- **Likelihood of Death**: Calculated the likelihood of death upon contracting COVID-19 for each country, providing a clear picture of mortality rates.
- **Highest Infection Rates**: Identified countries with the highest infection rates, highlighting areas with severe outbreaks.
- **Most Affected Nations**: By examining both infection rates and death counts, pinpointed the most affected nations.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Calculated the percentage of the global population that had been vaccinated, offering a snapshot of vaccination progress.
